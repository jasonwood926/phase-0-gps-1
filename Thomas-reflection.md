#Reflection
*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I had forgotten about local merging so it was nice to get more practice with that, overall I feel exceptionally comfortable with the other concepts. I have no problem abstracting the process.
*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Local merges and conflict resolution is now something I feel entirely comfortable with
*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
At one point I had to ask the guide for clarification on whether or not a definition we were using for a command was accurate or not. I like to asked my pair questions about their understanding before I moved on as navigator.
*What still confuses you about Git?
Very little if any of the basics covered as part of the DBC materials confuse me.
*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was wonderful. I felt like I contributed to a process in a meaningful way and the feedback reflected how well I felt I had done.
